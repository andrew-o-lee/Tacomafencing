
<h3>Thank You</h3>

<article>
	<p>For most of its early years Metro Tacoma Fencing Club relied exclusively on volunteer coaches who gave their time generously to help the club grow. We would not be here today without these coaches. We have had a number of coaches graduate, relocate, and retire given the longevity of this fencing club.</p>
	
	<p>We want to acknowledge and thank all these individuals and their contributions. We have pictures and a more recent biography of our most recent coaches and instructor assistants since our move to our Lakewood location in 2017.</p>
