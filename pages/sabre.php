<article>
	<p>Welcome to saber, the weapon that is so quick that bouts are usually not timed. In saber, both the edge and the point of the blade are used to score points, and everything above the waist is target.</p>

	<p>Classes are on Saturdays <time>8:30 AM</time>-<time>10:00 AM</time>, starting with a half hour of group warm-up, footwork, and a group lesson. The next hour (<time>9:00 AM</time>-<time>10:00 AM</time>) of class is a mix of paired drills and group lessons followed by bouting and often individual lessons. The instructor is Prevot de Sabre Joe Jasper. Fencers under 10 years old must be approved by Coach Jasper. Equipment for beginners is available. Light sabers are not available.</p>
