<h3>About Some of Our Fencers</h3>

<article>
	<p>Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) has had a number of fencers who have been successful at this sport. Our members participate in fencing recreationally, compete in tournaments locally, and even take it to national and international levels. We want to celebrate the hours of hard work and success of a number of our fencers and their families who have done well nationally and internationally. It takes a village to develop a highly skilled athlete with a lot of support from dedicated family, hard working teammates, generous club volunteers, and patient coaches.</p>
	<p>National medals are traditionally awarded to the top 8 finishers in an event. National events draw the very top fencers from the United States as well as from some other countries and can be as large as 400 fencers competing.</p>
