<article>
	<p>The Competitive Program is designed to provide appropriate training for fencers who wish to compete in fencing tournaments.</p>

	<p>The Competitive Program builds on the fencing skills developed in the Beginner Program. The lessons are more robust and fencers are expected to have a solid foundational framework for competitive-level fencing. Fencers in the Competitive Program typically compete regularly in local fencing tournaments and/or make fencing a significant part of their physical conditioning routine.</p>

	<p>This is a year-round program and students are expected to participate for the full 12 months from August 1, 2017 – July 31, 2018. Students are encouraged to compete in local events. They are also encouraged to compete in the regional events (RYC/RJCC/ROC) and may attend Summer Nationals/July Challenge.</p>

	<p>$120/month plus club membership. There is no pro-rating of fees due to absences, including during the summer months.</p>

	<p>Tuesdays and Thursdays <time>5:30 PM</time>-<time>6:30 PM</time>.</p>
